                                At Scode softwares, I worked as a Full Stack Developer focused on Laravel and Express.js. I developed full web applications, including admin dashboards and landing pages, and built RESTful APIs for a student mobile app, using Postman for testing and debugging. I also handled smaller backend tasks in Express.js and collaborated closely with the team to deliver clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.
